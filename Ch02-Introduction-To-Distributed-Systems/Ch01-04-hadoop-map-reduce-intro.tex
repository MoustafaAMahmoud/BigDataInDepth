%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[c]{ }
	\frametitle{The Driver }

	\begin{itemize}  [<+->]
		\item [--] The code that runs on the client machine configures the job details by creating an object from the \code{Job}  class, which implements the \code{JobContext} interface.
		\item [--] It submits the job to the cluster.		
		\item [--] It parses job arguments to identify job parameters, for example, input/output directories.. 
		
	\end{itemize}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[c]{ }
	\frametitle{The Driver:  Job Configuration}
	

The \code{Job}  object allows you to set configuration for your \code{Map-Reduce} job:
			\begin{itemize}  [<+->]
				\item [--] You can configure the \code{Mapper} \& the \code{Reducer} classes.
				\item [--] Set the \code{Mapper} input/output key \& value data types.
				\item [--] Set the \code{Reducer} input/output key \& value data types.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[c]{ }
	\frametitle{The Driver:  Job Configuration}
	
	\begin{itemize}  [<+->]
		\item [--] We can configure file input directory and output.
		\item [--] We configure the output path using \code{FileOutputFormat.setOutputPath()} to specify the reducers' directory to write the output data.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[c]{ }
	\frametitle{The Driver:  Job Configuration}
	
	\begin{itemize}  [<+->]
		\item [--] We configure the input path using \code{FileInputFormat.setInputPaths()}, and by default, it will read all the files in the specified directories and send them to the mappers.
		
		\item [--] We can use \code{Hadoop glob patterns} to read directory patterns, for example, \textit{/warehouse/public/sales*}.
		\item [--] We can call \code{FileInputFormat.addInputPath()} to multiple times by specifying a single file or directory.

		\begin{itemize}  [<+->]

			\item [--] You could set driver configurations globally using Hadoop configurations.

	Lunch a Map-Reduce job:
	\begin{itemize}  [<+->]
		
		\item [--] The \code{waitForCompletion()} method in the \code{Job} class launches the job and polls for progress. In addition, it writes the logs and summarizing the Map-Reduce job progress and changes.

	\item [--] When the job completes successfully, the job counters are displayed. Otherwise, the error that caused the job to fail is logged to the console.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[c]{ }
	\frametitle{InputFormat}
	
	\begin{itemize}  [<+->]
		\item [--] TheThe driver defines the \code{InputFormat}; then the \code{InputFormat} creates a \code{RecordReader"} object that parses the input data into key/value pairs passed to the mapper.
		\item [--] For example: \code{TextInputFormat}:
		\begin{itemize}  [<+->]
			
			\item It is the default.
			\item It creates \code{LineRecordReader} objects.
			\item Key: is the line offest in the file.

		\item [--] Values are objects which implement \code{Writable}.
		\item [--] Keys are objects which implement \code{WritableComparable}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[c]{ }
	\frametitle{What is Writable?}
	
	\begin{itemize}  [<+->]
		\item [--] \code{Writable} is an interface in Hadoop.
		\item [--] \code{Writables} are used for data type "serialization" in Hadoop to translate/serialize "primitive java data types" to "Hadoop data types", Ex: int to IntWritable and String to Text.
		\item [--] Hadoop uses the \code{Writable} interface for data transfer in the cluster and network.
		
		
	\end{itemize}		
	
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[c]{ }
	\frametitle{What is WritableComparable?}
	
	\begin{itemize}  [<+->]
		\item [--] A \code{WritableComparable} is a \code{Writable} which is also \code{Comparable}.
		\item [--] We can compare two \code{WritableComparables} against each other to determine their \textbf{\underline{\textit{order}}}, for example, we could need to compare the order of two Text "Apple vs. Cat or numbers ordering" to understand the ordering mechanism. 
		\item [--] Obviously, the reason we have Keys to be \code{WritableComparable} is that they are passed to the reducer in \underline{\textit{\textbf{sorted order}}}.
		\item [--] Note: All Hadoop implemented types are both \code{Writable} and \code{WritableComparable}.

		\item [--] All mapper must specify the key and values for input and output.		
		
		\item [--] All mappers must override the \code{map} method and pass the key, value, and \code{Context}.
