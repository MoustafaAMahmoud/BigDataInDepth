	\begin{itemize}  [<+->]
		\item [--] Moving data between nodes is one of the bottlenecks in distributed systems.
		\item [--] 	We need to find always solutions to reduce the amount of data movement in the network.
		\item [--] In most cases, mappers produce large amounts of intermediate data passed on to the reducers for further processing. This leads to enormous network congestion.
		\item [--] One of the solutions is to reduce the mapper output using combiners. using \textbf{\underline{\textit{combiners "mini-reducer".}}}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[c]{ }
	\frametitle{How Combiner Works? }
	
	
	\begin{itemize}  [<+->]
		\item [--] The combiner must implement the \code{Reducer} interfaceâ€™s \code{reduce()} method.
		
		\item [--] The combiner process on each map output key \& value (same as the Reducer). 

	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[c]{ }
	\frametitle{Combiners and Reducers }
	
	Combiner and Reducer code are often identical. 
	\begin{itemize}  [<+->]
	
	\item [--] Combiner \& Reducer must have identical input and output data types.
	
	\item [--] The operation must be  commutative and associative.
	\end{itemize}
